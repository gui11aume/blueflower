Welcome to blueflower!

At the heart of the project lies the BrowserDecoy class. For the moment, this is not required, as www.cell.com does not block crawlers. This will turn out useful later.

To get started you can call the first script from the command line.
$ python fetch_urls_full_text.py > all_links_to_full_text.txt
